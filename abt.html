<p class="here">I still remember how shy I was when I first met you HAHAHA apir!!, na nireklamo mo na apir lang HAHAHAHA im sorry love,
     I am so grateful that time na even if we didn't get to eat together we have a little bonding, although nahihiya pa both sides, but even if that day was embarrassing for me hehe since all that I do when we first met was a high five, It's a treasure and the memory that I adore, I tend to forgot memories but that day is one of the best memories I had.
     
     <p class="here"> 
     When we first talked romantically, I didn't expect na that's the start of me being so in love with a girl, You are the best gift that an old friend gave to me, We clicked as soon as we talked, we got comfortable in just a mean time, and lastly we are already open to each other in just a month of talking, I still remember how I always teased you with the word "Kamatis", I hate kamatis but if the kamatis on the topic is you then I do love kamatis, I really love kamatis!!.
    </p>
    <p class="here"> 
     I know we had a major problem back then because I still don't know if I can commit because of a trauma, But then again you stayed and wait for me which I am grateful for, I'm sorry that I make you wait for so long for me to be ready, but dont worry love I promise that It will always be worth it.
    </p>
